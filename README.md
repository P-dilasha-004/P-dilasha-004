# ✨ Hi, I'm Dilasha! 
I’m a rising Sophomore at Fisk University, majoring in Computer Science. I’m a goal-oriented person who loves brainstorming, ideating, coding, and building innovative solutions. Recently, I’ve been learning deep learning and mathematical models, and I am truly fascinated by how deeply math shapes the world around us. 

To the core, I am a people-person. I learn best through conversations, collaboration, and building alongside others. I am ever excited to meet new people, learn from their inspiring work and insights, and collaborate on meaningful projects. 

When I'm not at my keyboard, I'm happiest by the water 🏖. I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects or just connecting to chat about tech 💻, aviation ✈️, nutrition 🥝, or yoga 🧘🏻‍♀️!

Currently, I am looking for internships or research opportunities. If you’re looking for a team member with fresh ideas, thoughtful questions, and purpose-driven ambitions, let’s connect and collaborate!
