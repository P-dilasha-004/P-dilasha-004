# ‚ú® Hi, I'm Dilasha! 
I‚Äôm a Computer Science major at Fisk University with a passion for coding, problem-solving, and building innovative solutions. I thrive at the intersection of finance and technology, where I enjoy applying machine learning and mathematical models to real-world problems. Lately, I‚Äôve been diving into C++ and learning to develop efficient, low-latency systems.

To the core, I am a people-person. I learn best through conversations, collaboration, and building alongside others. I am ever excited to meet new people, learn from their inspiring work and insights, and collaborate on meaningful projects. 

When I'm not at my keyboard, I'm happiest by the water üèñ. I'm always open to collaborating on interesting projects or just connecting to chat about tech üíª, aviation ‚úàÔ∏è, nutrition ü•ù, or yoga üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è!

Currently, I am looking for internships or research opportunities. If you‚Äôre looking for a team member with fresh ideas, thoughtful questions, and purpose-driven ambitions, let‚Äôs connect and collaborate!
